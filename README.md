## Task 1  
Implement the method nextNum() and a minimal but effective set of unit tests.
Make sure your code is exemplary, as if it was going to be shipped as part of a production system.
As a quick check, given Random Numbers are [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3] and Probabilities are [0.01, 0.3, 0.58, 0.1, 0.01] if we call nextNum() 100 times
we may get the following results.
As the results are random, these particular results are unlikely.

## Task 2

Write an sql query to find books that have sold fewer than 10 copies in the last year, excluding books that have been available for
less than 1 month.
1 month is really generic I have set 30 days instead
